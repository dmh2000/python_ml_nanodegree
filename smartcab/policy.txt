**Answer:** 

**Optimal Policy**

Definition: 'legal' means an action does not violate traffic rules, as defined in the DummyAgent object in the Environment object

*Rules:*
    1. don't take any illegal actions (this will prevent accidents)
    
*Policy:*
<pre>
If the planner.next_waypoint is a legal action:
....make that the action, because the planner always moves towards the destination 
If the planner.next_waypoint is not a legal action:
....determine the set of available actions that are legal and have the highest Q score
....('None' will always be legal)
....from that set, select one at random (should it be 'select one that moves towards the destination?)
</pre>            

** Actual Policy **
