Assume the planner next_waypoint is the best move to make at any given step
Definition: 'legal' means an action does not violate traffic rules

If the next_waypoint is a legal action:
    make that the action

If the next waypoint is not a legal action:
    determine which other valid actions are legal
    ('None' will always be legal)
    from the set of valid actions,
        if  one of them moves in the direction of the destination
            choose that one
        else
            choose None
    The rationale here is that to arrive at the destination in time,
    it is better to not move away from the destination. Not moving
    at all is better that moving away
