Training approach

training a lot of models
use cross validation to select model with best F1 score
test with test data

training a Logistic Regression Model
-------------------------------------
train with polynomials of several degrees (1-4)
use cross validation to calculate F1 score
pick model with highest F1 score
test with test data


degrees of polynomial is a hyperparameter (meta parameter)

Decision Tree
hyperparameters -> depth

Support Vector Machine
-----------------------
Hyperparameters -> kernel, gamma


Grid Search Cross Validation
----------------------------
make a grid with each axis a hyperparameter
test all combinations of hyper parameters


How to Solve a Problem

Problem -> Tools -> Measurement tools

Data -> Algorithms -> Metrics

Algorithms -> Decision Tree, Regression, SVM etc
Metrics -> Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1, Model Complexity Graph, Learning Curves
