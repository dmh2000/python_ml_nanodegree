Three learning models were selected for evaluation of their prediction ability. They included LinearSVC (Linear Support Vector Classifier),
 DecisionTreeClassifier and Adaboost Classifier. Each of these models were trained with a subset of the existing data and the results visualized in the
 above chart. The criteria for selection are runtime and score metrics on the Test data set. There is a significant difference in training and prediction
 time between the AdaboostClassifier and the other two models. The Adaboost model takes much longer. The score metrics are similar for all three models,
 with the Adaboost model slightly better than the other two.
I have selected Adaboost model since its score metrics are best, at a cost of longer time to get the results. However, if over time the training data set
grows much larger and the time to train and predict becomes excessive, a switch to the LinearSVC model can be used instead at a slight loss in prediction quality but much shorter run time.
