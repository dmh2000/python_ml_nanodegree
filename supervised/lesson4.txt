continuous vs discrete output

classification
    labels
    uses 'accuracy'
    decision boundary
regressions
    values
    uses r2
    numerical model


r2   best fit = 1.0
     0 = no correlation
     not affected by number of points


error = difference between actual and predicted

sum of squared error
    differentiable
    amplifies differences in error
    unique solution vs sum of absolute values
    computationally efficient
    disadvantage : more points means larger SSE for comparisons

algorithms:
    ordinary least squares - closed form, solve linear system of equations
    gradient descent



y = 5x1 + 2.5x2 - 80
