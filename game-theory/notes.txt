Game Theory
    mathematics of conflict
    involving multiple agents
    economics, politics, biology




strategies : mapping of all possible states and actions

pure strategy  :
    zero-sum finite deterministic game of perfect information
    there always exists an optimal pure strategy for each player
    all players are attempting to maximize their result
mixed strategy :
    a probability is assigned to each pure strategy
    zero sum, non-deterministic game of perfect information
    non-zero sum, non deterministic game of hidden information

prisoners dilemma

1 defect other coop
2 defect other coop
both defect
both coop
                       B
             coop            defect
    coop     -1,-1            -9,0
A
    defect   0,-9             -6,-6 <- dominates, never coop

strict dominance


Nash Equilibrium


n players with n strategies are a Nash Equilibrium IFF
Si* = argmax-Si utility(S1*,S2*,...,Sn*)

no one person needs to change strategy in a world where
everyone else keeps their strategy the same

works with pure or mixed strategies

in the n-player pure strategy game, if elimination
of strictly dominated strategies eliminates all but
one combination, that combination is the unique NE

any NE will survive elimination of strictly dominatED strategies

if n is finite and strategies are finite, there exists a (possibly mixed) NE


Mechanism Design : set of incentives to get desired behavior

Stochastic Games and Multiagent RL

MDP : RL == stochastic game: multiagent RL

Stochastic Games
----------------
S: states
Ai : actions for i
T: transitions
Ri : rewards for i
gamma : discount

zero sum stochastic games (minimax-Q)
-------------------------
    value iteration works
    minimax-Q converges
    unique solution to Q*
    policies can be computed independently
    update efficient
    Q functions sufficient to specify policy

General sum stochastic games (Nash-Q)
----------------------------
    value iteration does not work
    Nash-Q doesn't converge
    no unique solution to Q*
    policies can't be computed independently
    update not efficient unless P = PPAD
    Q functions not sufficient to specify policy


Ideas for solving general sum games
-----------------------------------
repeated stochastic games (folk theorem)
cheap talk -> correlated equilibrium
cognitive hierarchy -> best responses
side payments (coco values)
